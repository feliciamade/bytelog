            <p class="scrollable-paragraph"> <span> Computer Vision </span> is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that enables computers 
                to see and interpret images and videos. Computer vision excels when used for
                special effects in movies, augmented reality, intelligent transportation systems,
                and more. However, computer vision is not always reliable. An example of computer
                vision being unreliable is when it was used in a criminal case to determine the
                suspect of a theft crime. The individual was falsey acussed and had to spend 30
                hours in jail. To combat this issue, researches and companies are actively improving facial
                recogintion so it can be fairer and more accurate. In addition, they are builder smarter 
                algorithums that focus on the right features and treat everyone equally. In addition, they
                are learning how to interpret tricky photos by sharpening the images, fixing angles and lightening, 
                liveness checks, and more.
